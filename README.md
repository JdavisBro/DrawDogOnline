You can replace default with a port number.

## Discord Authentication

> Note: Using Discord authentication requires SSL / using the wss:// protocol

add `--authtype discord` to your launch arguments

make an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Go to OAuth2 -> General. Copy client id and put it in a file named `client_id` in below dir. Do the same with the secret in `client_secret`

- Windows: `%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Draw Dog Online\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/Godot/app_userdata/Draw Dog Online/`

Add `http://127.0.0.1:38493/` to the redirect url

Also add `WebVersionHost/auth.html` (e.g. `https://jdavisbro.github.io/DrawDogOnline/auth.html`) to support web version

> if you're hosting this web version make sure to include the auth.html in the root of the respository

## Contributing/Exporting

Requires

- [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/)
- [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/)

First (before opening the repo in Godot) create an Export_Sprites and Exported_Sounds with UndertaleModTool and move it to this repo dir.

Add a file named `.gdignore` to Export_Sprites/

In the base dir run `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and `py move_assets.py`

Now you can open it (and export if you want) in Godot :D

To import the brush sounds properly, find sfx/erase/loop/mono.wav and sfx/paint/medium_loop.wav in the assets folder. Select them and, from the import tab (top left), select Loop Mode > Forward and Reimport.
